Hey everyone, hope you're all good!

I’d like to bring light to DTech Services (www.dtech-services.co.za) — a platform designed by students, for students.

It’s a space where you can sell or rent out things you no longer need — textbooks, clothes, electronics, and more. You can also promote your services, like tutoring, hairdressing, laptop repairs, and any other skills you have to offer. Currently only assistance with word and Excel are available 
Want to promote your services? Text me at 0670015423.

The aim is simple: students supporting students — helping each other earn and save

If you’ve got something to sell, rent, or offer, join us Feel free to share this with others who might benefit too"
