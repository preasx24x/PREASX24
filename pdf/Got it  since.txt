Got it — since you're using a school computer and want to avoid installing or downloading extra software, here are lighter, browser-based or no-install options to help you fetch and download files (like PDFs) from a website:


---

1. Bookmarklet Method – “Get all links”

You can use a simple JavaScript bookmarklet in Chrome to extract all downloadable links (like PDFs) from a page:

How to set it up:

1. Bookmark any page


2. Right-click the bookmark > Edit


3. Change the URL to this:



javascript:(function(){var links=document.getElementsByTagName('a');for(var i=0;i<links.length;i++){var href=links[i].href;if(href.match(/\.(pdf|zip|docx|xlsx|mp3)$/i)){window.open(href);}}})();

4. Visit a webpage with downloadable files


5. Click your bookmark — it will open all matching files in new tabs, ready to save



> You can customize the file types in the match() part.

2. Use an Online Tool – No Install

Example:

https://tools.webdevpuneet.com/extract-all-links/
or
https://www.websiteseochecker.com/extract-links/

Paste the URL of the webpage

It will extract all links (including direct file links)

You can then copy and paste the PDF links into your browser or download them



---

3. Developer Tools Method (Built into Chrome)

1. Open the website with downloadable content


2. Press F12 (or right-click → Inspect)


3. Go to the Console tab


4. Paste this snippet:



Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a')).map(a => a.href).filter(href => href.endsWith('.pdf'))

5. Press Enter — it’ll list all PDF links, which you can right-click and download manually

Best for You:

If you're just trying to get PDFs or assignments from a page, the bookmarklet + online link extractor options are best — no downloads, fully browser-based.

Let me know the site you're trying to get files from, and I can help you extract them.
